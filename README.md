### Projects:
- Discord bot
-  SYN request flooder
-  Autoclicker
-  A few more that aren't as significant
- *All of these were made with Python*

### Where can I contact you?
Glad you asked, you can contact me via Discord. My Discord account ID is 871131144626790420. Why am I putting the ID and not the name and tag? Well, I change my name and tag very often, so this is the easiest way for you to reach out to me.

### Can you help me with something?
I am open to questions and can provide help on a project if possible. Please note that I am only experienced in the topics listed under "competencies." Regardless, still message me, even if it isn't there. Maybe I'll offer some advice or maybe I'll learn a thing or two myself.

Thank you for reading about me. I plan on learning new programming languages such as HTML and Javascript and gaining more experience. If you have any tips, gladly reach out.
